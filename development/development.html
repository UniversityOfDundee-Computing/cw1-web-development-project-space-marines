                        Development of the game began after the release of
                        Killer Instinct 2, in which a team was split into making
                        Killer Instinct Gold for the Nintendo 64 and a new
                        racing game for that console.[10] During development,
                        the game became influenced by Walt Disney World and soon
                        evolved into an adventure game called Wild Cartoon
                        Kingdom, with which Nintendo had no involvement. In June
                        1997, the game was altered to Pro-Am 64, an unrelated
                        follow-up to the NES racing game R.C. Pro-Am.[10][11]
                        According to Lee Schuneman, the Pro Am 64 project
                        featured three-wheeled trikes in contrast to
                        radio-controlled cars.[11]

                        With Banjo-Kazooie being delayed until the summer of
                        1998, the team was adamant for a release of an AAA video
                        game in time for 1997's Christmas season. Rare felt that
                        Pro Am 64 did not have a strong enough intellectual
                        property to capture the attention of consumers, and thus
                        changed the licence to feature Diddy Kong.[10] According
                        to Lee Musgrave, the decision to choose Diddy Kong
                        rather than Donkey Kong was based on their own choice, a
                        decision which Nintendo "enjoyed". Once the intellectual
                        property was changed, the team were left to adapt the
                        visual aesthetics of the game and packaging before it
                        could be released.[10] Musgrave recalled that the
                        ultimate goal of the game was to make it "run as fast"
                        as Mario Kart 64, which proved difficult during
                        development as the latter game utilised 2D character
                        sprites whereas Diddy Kong Racing used fully 3D models.

                        Musgrave later attributed the success of the overall
                        project due to the "small team" of 14 people who worked
                        on it.[10] In an October 2012 interview, Musgrave said
                        that Timber the Tiger would have been the main character
                        of Pro Am 64 had the intellectual property for Diddy
                        Kong Racing not been conceived.[12] Two of the
                        characters who featured in Diddy Kong Racing, Banjo the
                        Bear and Conker the Squirrel, starred in games
                        (Banjo-Kazooie and Conker's Bad Fur Day, respectively)
                        which were unveiled to the public before Diddy Kong
                        Racing, at the June 1997 Electronic Entertainment Expo
                        (E3), but ultimately not released until after Diddy Kong
                        Racing.[13][14] Rare stated that they chose not to
                        exhibit Diddy Kong Racing at E3 because of the
                        proprietary animation technology used in the game.[14]
